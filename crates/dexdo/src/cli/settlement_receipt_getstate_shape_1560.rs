//! the settlement receipt's `current` block reads the `getState()` the COMPILED ABI
//! declares, and the payloads that prove it are keyed from that ABI rather than from literals here.

//! What went wrong is worth stating exactly, because the test that should have caught it was green
//! the whole time. `parse_current` required `prepaid`, `frozen`, `prepaidTime` and `lastAdvance` --
//! the pre-4.0.31 prepaid/frozen buffer. `TokenContract.getState()` has declared none of them since
//! that generation, so on every live deal the parse returned `None`, the receipt pushed
//! `current_getter_shape_invalid`, and a non-empty `consistency_issues` made BOTH `terminal.status`
//! and `withdrawal.status` read `inconsistent` while the whole `current` block was omitted. A money
//! document declared itself untrustworthy on every deal it was ever run against.

//! It survived because the fixture beside it fed the parser the same four invented names, so the
//! test confirmed the PARSER against itself and never once mentioned the contract. That is the
//! defect this module is built to make impossible: every payload below takes its keys from
//! `contracts/compiled/airegistry/TokenContract.abi.json`, so a field the chain renames drops out
//! of the fixture and reddens these tests instead of being quietly agreed with.

//! The four assertions are deliberately different in kind:
//! - the ABI-shaped payload produces a receipt with NO issues (the fix works);
//! - dropping any ONE ABI-declared field produces `inconsistent` (every field is really required,
//! so a parser that stops reading one cannot pass here);
//! - the superseded prepaid/frozen shape is REFUSED;
//! - a refusal NAMES the field it refused on, beside the machine code rather than instead of it
//! -- the decoder always had that sentence and `parse_current` used to discard it, which is why
//! identifying the four dead fields took a hand comparison against the compiled ABI.
