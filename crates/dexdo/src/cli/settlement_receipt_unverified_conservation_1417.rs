//! The conservation verdict must not be `conserved` when nothing was cross-checked.

//! # The defect this pins

//! `conservation_receipt` prefers the NOTES for the payout term, because they are a statement by
//! different accounts than the deal's own. When fewer than two notes were read it falls back to the
//! deal's own `declared_payout` -- and from there the identity is self-referential:

//! ```text
//! payout = declared_payout (the deal's own figure)
//! written_off = funded_in - payout ("implied_by_conservation")
//! unexplained = funded_in - payout - (funded_in - payout) == 0, for every input
//! ```

//! So the receipt printed `conserved` -- "the money adds up" -- having compared one number with
//! itself. On the real deal the figures are `funded_in = 12 200 000 000`, declared payout
//! `11 175 400 000`, implied write-off `1 024 600 000`, and `unexplained = 0` whether or not a
//! single note was ever read. The fallback branch had no test: the sibling file's fixture hardcodes
//! `notes_read: vec![BUYER, SELLER]`, so the degenerate path was never executed.

//! # Both directions, deliberately

//! A test that only proved the refusal would leave an always-red verdict, which is the worse
//! failure: a status that is never `conserved` carries no information either. So the first case
//! below drives two notes that agree and requires `conserved` to still be reachable.
