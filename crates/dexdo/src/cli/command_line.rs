//! Which values the operator actually gave, as opposed to the ones clap filled in.

//! A struct field carries a value and says nothing about where it came from: `args.ticks == 2` reads
//! the same whether the operator wrote `--ticks 2` or the default did. That difference is what
//! decides whether a question may be asked. Asking again for something already answered on the
//! command line makes the operator answer twice with no way to know which answer the command used;
//! not asking for something they never answered means a money command proceeds on a value nobody
//! chose.

//! Clap keeps the distinction in `ArgMatches::value_source`, and the parse in `main` used to throw
//! the matches away. It does not any more, and this module is where the answer is looked up.

//! Reading `std::env::args()` instead -- searching argv for the flag's spelling -- is what this
//! replaces, and it is wrong in four ways, each of which produces a false "the operator answered"
//! and therefore a question that is never asked:

//! 1. **A value equal to the flag counts as the flag.** Values here are model ids, addresses and
//! free text; `--frame-model=--ticks` makes a scan believe `--ticks` was given.
//! 2. **Short forms are invisible.** A scan for `--ticks` cannot see `-t 2`.
//! 3. **Everything after `--` counts.** That is exactly where arguments meant for someone else go.
//! 4. **Another subcommand's flag counts.** A scan has no idea which command is running.

//! Every one of the four is measured below against this module, on shapes the argv scan gets wrong.
