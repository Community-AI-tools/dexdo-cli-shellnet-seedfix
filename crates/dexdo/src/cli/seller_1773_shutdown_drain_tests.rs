// a watcher that is told to stop must RETURN, because the pool DRAINS its watchers.

// The pool does not drop its watchers when the operator's signal arrives -- it awaits every one of
// them (`run_seller_pool`, the `watched.next().await` loop), and that is deliberate: a dropped
// watcher takes the identity a relist advanced with it, and the sweep would then prove the absence
// of a generation the book has already consumed.

// So an un-stoppable watcher makes the drain unbounded. Measured live on the test chain before the fix:
// the signal reached the pool, the shutdown arm fired, and the process then ran on for a further
// 591 log lines of chain traffic with no cancellation, no terminal and no `stopping` event --
// because the watcher had been handed `futures::future::pending()` as its stop.

// THE FIXTURE IS THE POINT. This builds its own backend with `matched = false`, so nothing crosses
// the ask and the supervisor keeps watching until something stops it. That is what makes the test
// able to fail: with a matched backend the watcher returns down the match path and never consults
// the stop at all, which is exactly why the pre-existing signal regression
// (`seller_sigint_emits_shutdown_jsonl`) passes over this defect -- measured, its `watched` is
// EMPTY at the drain, so it drains nothing.

/// a fired stop must end the watch instead of leaving the pool's drain unbounded.
